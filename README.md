## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! To contribute potential features or bug-fixes:

1. Fork this repository
2. Base the feature or fix off the `develop` branch. This is to allow for pre-release versions without affecting the main general releases.
3. Apply any changes and/or additions based off an existing issue (or create a new issue for the feature/fix you are working on)
4. Create a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged

## Building From Source

### Installing Flutter and Related Dependencies

Thunder is developed with Flutter, and is built to support both iOS and Android. There may be unofficial support on other platforms but is not guaranteed at this time (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

To build the app from source, a few steps are required.

1. Set up and install Flutter. For more information, visit https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install.
2. Ensure that you are on Flutter's `beta` channel using `flutter channel beta`.
2. Clone this repository and fetch the dependencies using `flutter pub get`
4. Run `flutter gen-l10n` to generate the localization files.
5. Optional: Run the build script using `dart scripts/build.dart`, which will build both the iOS and Android release versions. This step is only required if you want to build a release version of the app.

### Building with Docker

Alternatively, you can skip the prerequisite setup and build the Android application via docker with a single command:

```bash
./scripts/docker-build-android.sh
```

#### Developing with Docker

You can also run your local development environment for Android via the Docker container, including connecting to ADB on the host machine.

```
./scripts/docker-dev-android.sh
```

### Environment File

This is an example of the `.env` that can be used for Thunder.

```bash
# Empty Environment File
```

## Conventions

While there are no specific conventions that must be followed, do try to follow best practices whenever possible.

Suggestions are always welcome to improve the code quality and architecture of the app!
