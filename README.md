## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! To contribute potential features or bug-fixes:

1. Fork this repository
2. Apply any changes and/or additions based off an existing issue (or create a new issue for the feature/fix you are working on)
3. Create a pull request to have your changes reviewed and merged

## Building From Source

### Installing Flutter and Related Dependencies

Thunder is developed with Flutter, and is built to support both iOS and Android. There may be limited support on other platforms but is not guaranteed at this time (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

To build the app from source, a few steps are required.

1. Set up and install Flutter.
   - For more information, visit https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install.
2. Clone this repository and fetch the dependencies using `flutter pub get`
3. Generate an empty `.env` file. The `.env` file holds any credentials. At the time of writing, en empty `.env` file with a comment is all that is required.
3. Run the build script using `dart scripts/build.dart`, which will build both the iOS and Android release versions

### Building with Docker

Alternatively, you can skip the prerequisite setup and build the Android application via docker with a single command:
```
./scripts/docker-build-android.sh
```

### Developing with Docker

You can also run your local development environment for Android via the Docker container, including connecting to ADB on the host machine.
```
./scripts/docker-dev-android.sh
```

### Environment File
This is an example of the `.env` that can be used for Thunder.
```bash
# Sentry Credentials
SENTRY_DSN=""
```

## Conventions

While there are no specific conventions that must be followed, do try to follow best practices whenever possible.

Suggestions are always welcome to improve the code quality and architecture of the app!

## Related Packages

Thunder uses the following packages and libraries under the hood. This is not an exhaustive list.

### Custom Built Libraries
