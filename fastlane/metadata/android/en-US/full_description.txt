Thunder is a fully open source, cross-platform, community-driven project available on GitHub. Fully free of advertisements and trackers.

Here's a peek at what Thunder offers:
- Multi-account support: Login to all your accounts, and switch between them at ease
- Fully customizable settings: Choose your own splash of accent, customize your own gestures, and much more
- Swipe gestures: Navigate and interact with your favourite communities, posts, and comments all through customizable swipe gestures.

Thunder is still very early on in development and many more features are yet to be available!
